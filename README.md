 ### Attrition by Job satisfaction rating
 The Lab technician, Sales Executive and Research scientist takes the lead at the attrition based on Job satisfaction where as the managers tend to be satisfied by thier job roles.

 ### Recommendation
 These departments should be looked into and provided with program and incentives that could make the role more satsfactory. Insurance policy should be adopted.


### Atrition by Distance and Income
The trend shows that people coming from far distance and low income earners has the lowest attrition rate, meaning the level of attrition is not caused by salary or distance.

 ### Recommendation
  Since renumeration and distance is not the issue, other aspect should be studied to reduce the attrition rate. aspects like, Company policy, dressing, health insurance, career building policy and Talent management.

  ### Conclusion
   Key findings reveal that attrition is most prevalent among employees aged 25–34, particularly in roles such as Lab Technicians and Sales Executives. Employees with Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Life Sciences and Medical fields also exhibit higher turnover rates. Interestingly, factors such as salary and commuting distance showed minimal impact on attrition, indicating deeper issues tied to job satisfaction and employee engagement. 
   By leveraging these data-driven insights, The Incubator Hub can take proactive steps to reduce attrition, strengthen employee retention, and build a more engaged and stable workforce.
